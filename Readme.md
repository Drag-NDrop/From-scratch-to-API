# From scratch to API

Welcome to the demo..  

I've documented the most important thougts i've had in the process(not that important though?)  
  
Browse the links at your own leisure, or break a leg and figure it all out yourself.  
Either way - please let me know if you get some cool ideas for improving the solution.  

To run the Database ReSeed tool, fire the ReSeed.ps1, in the database code folder.  
Keep in mind that you should update the values there, to reflect your own installation/setup.  
Documentation: [Database Reseeding Tool](<./Database code/Database code.md>)  

To run the .Net Core Web API bootstrapper, fire the Bootstrap-Demo.ps1 in the CodeGen folder.  
Keep in mind that you should update the variables in the top of the script, to reflect your own installation/setup.

This project wasn't completely developed overnight. It's been some time underway. The presentation was just the spark i needed to get it out of my mind, and into functional code(well.. script code, anyways).  
Below is the original documentation of the solution. Perhaps you will find useful perspectives there. Perhaps not.. Either way, enjoy.
